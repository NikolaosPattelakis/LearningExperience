HTML file

Add border to each element
Add border to image
Add different colours in list (even light blue, odd, light gray)
Add a like element, as "Likes: 0", number in red colour

#3 Project 3
Change all elements into div elements, but keep current format
Divide "Title: Minecraft" and all similar elements into two elements "Title:" and "Minecraft". Keep them inline


#Project 4
Create a js file called home.js
Link html to that js file
Inside the js file, create a variable holding the like count
Likes = 5
When html loads, load the variable and read the amount of likes, so that "Likes: 0" becomes "Likes: 5"

#Project 5
Add an array with the names of the players
Remove the list of players from html and generate that list from home.js
Customize the "Likes:" element to handle clicks, when pressed it should increase the likes on the page by 1 each time.
